                        <div class="text-body">
                            <p>Grounded Object Referring is the task of locating objects in an image based on natural language descriptions—for example, "the man in a blue shirt" or "the dog sitting under the table." Unlike standard object detection, this task requires a deeper understanding of both visual details and linguistic nuances, including attributes, spatial relationships, and interactions.</p>
                            
                            <p>What makes it <em>grounded</em> is the focus on explainable and verifiable reasoning. Instead of guessing the object from the description, a grounded model reasons step-by-step—just like a human would. It first identifies possible candidates, then examines each one carefully based on the description, and finally selects the best match. This process reduces hallucination (predicting non-existent objects) and makes the model's decisions transparent and trustworthy.</p>
                            
                            <p>Our model, Rex-Thinker, tackles this task using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, breaking down each decision into clear steps: Planning, Action, and Summarization. Combined with our HumanRef-CoT dataset and fine-tuning methods, this leads to state-of-the-art accuracy and interpretability.</p>

                            <p>HumanRef-CoT is a large-scale dataset designed to support Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for the Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) task. It includes 90,824 high-quality annotations generated using GPT-4o, based on the HumanRef dataset—a benchmark focusing on complex, human-centric referring expressions.</p>
                            
                            <p>Each annotation follows a structured CoT reasoning format with three stages:</p>
                            
                            <ul class="cot-stages">
                                <li><strong>Planning:</strong> Decomposes the referring expression into subgoals.</li>
                                <li><strong>Action:</strong> Evaluates each candidate region step-by-step using box-level visual hints.</li>
                                <li><strong>Summarization:</strong> Aggregates the reasoning results to produce the final prediction.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>To generate these annotations, we use GPT-4o with carefully designed in-context prompts, grounded visual markers, and strict answer verification. Only samples where the model's final prediction matches the ground truth are retained.</p>

                            <p>To effectively teach the model how to reason step-by-step, we adopt a two-stage training pipeline:</p>
                            
                            <h3>Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)</h3>
                            <p>We start by fine-tuning the model on the HumanRef-CoT dataset using token-level supervision. This stage teaches the model to generate structured reasoning traces—including planning, action, and summarization—guided by ground-truth annotations. The goal is to instill the model with a strong foundation in Chain-of-Thought reasoning grounded in visual evidence.</p>
                            
                            <h3>GRPO-Based Reinforcement Learning</h3>
                            <p>After SFT, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to further improve performance. GRPO enables the model to explore alternative reasoning paths by sampling multiple responses and reinforcing those that achieve higher task-level rewards. This enhances the model's generalization, robustness, and ability to handle ambiguous or out-of-distribution cases, while also reducing hallucinations.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Together, these two stages result in a model that is not only accurate, but also interpretable and trustworthy in its reasoning process.</strong></p>

Question: Please detect the youngest one.
Answer:
<think>
OK, the user needs us to detect the youngest one. To accomplish this task, I need to break it down into the following steps:
- Step 1: Determine the age-related attributes of each person.
- Step 2: Compare the age-related attributes to find the youngest one.

# Step 1: Determine the age-related attributes of each person
- Person 1: A young girl with light-colored hair, wearing a white outfit. She appears to be a child. ⚠️
- Person 2: A woman with long brown hair, wearing a light-colored top and white pants. She is an adult. ❌
- Person 3: A man with short hair, wearing a beige sweater and brown pants. He is an adult. ❌
- Person 4: A young boy with light-colored hair, wearing a patterned shirt. He appears to be a child. ⚠️

# Step 2: Compare the age-related attributes to find the youngest person
Among the four people, Person 1 and Person 4 are children, while Person 2 and Person 3 are adults. Comparing Person 1 and Person 4, they both seem to be of similar young-age, but based on visual cues like height and overall appearance, Person 4 appears to be slightly younger.

# Summarize and Re-Check answer
Let's now recheck our answer and put ✅ for the target person and ❌ for others
- Person 1: She is a young girl but not the youngest. ❌
- Person 2: She is an adult. ❌
- Person 3: He is an adult. ❌
- Person 4: He is the youngest one. ✅</think>

Question: Please detect the potato, and tell me how to pick and place it into the container using the robot gripper.
Answer:
<think>OK, the user needs us to detect the potato and tell us how to pick and place it into the container using the robot gripper. In order to accomplish this task, I need to break it down into the following steps:
- Step 1: Identify the potato among the objects present.
- Step 2: Determine the position of the container.
- Step 3: Use the robot gripper to pick up the potato and place it into the container.

# Step 1: Identify the potato among the objects present
There are two objects labeled as "potato" in the image. Let's analyze them:
- Object 1: It is a yellow-colored object resting on an orange cloth. This is the potato we are looking for. ⚠️
- Object 2: There is no such object visible in the image that matches the description of a potato in relation to the given labels. ❌
# Step 2: Determine the position of the container
The container in the image is a silver-colored pot located towards the right-hand side of the wooden surface.
# Step 3: Use the robot gripper to pick up the potato and place it into the container
The robot gripper is positioned near the potato (Object 1). To pick up the potato, the gripper should be closed around the potato and then lifted. Once lifted, the gripper should be brought close to the container and the potato should be placed inside the container.

# Summarize and Re-Check answer
Let's now recheck our answer and put ✅ for the target object and ❌ for others
- Object 1: It is the potato and will be picked up by the robot gripper and placed into the container. ✅
- Object 2: Not relevant to the task as there is no such object matching the description. ❌ </think>

Question: Please detect car in a crash
Answer:
<think>OK, the user needs us to detect the cars that are in a crash. In order to accomplish this task, I need to break it down into the following steps:
- Step 1: Examine each of the 22 cars to determine if they are involved in a crash. Let's start our analysis:

# Step 1: Examine each of the 22 cars to determine if they are involved in a crash
- Car 1: This car is clearly damaged and is surrounded by emergency vehicles and people, indicating it is in a crash. ⚠️
- Car 2: This car is also damaged and is in close proximity to other damaged cars and emergency-related activity, so it is in a crash. ⚠️
- Car 3: There are no visible signs of damage or being involved in an accident-like situation. ❌
- Car 4: Appears to be undamaged and not part of any crash-related activity. ❌
- Car 5: Is damaged and is among other damaged cars, so it is in a crash. ⚠️
- Car 6: There are no clear signs of being in a crash. ❌
...
- Car 22: No visible signs of being in a crash. ❌

# Summarize and Re-Check answer
Let's now recheck our answer and put ✅ for the target cars and ❌ for others
- Car 1: Is in a crash → ✅
- Car 2: Is in a crash → ✅
- Car 3: Is not in a crash → ❌
- Car 4: Is not in a crash → ❌

Question: Please detect all person to the right of the person wearing a yellow tie
Answer:
<think> OK, the user needs us to detect all person to the right of the person wearing a yellow tie. In order to accomplish this task, I need to break it down into the following steps:
- Step 1: Find the person wearing a yellow tie.
- Step 2: Identify all the people to the right of the person found in Step 1

# Step 1: Find the person wearing a yellow tie
I see seven people in this image. Let's check their ties and put a ⚠️ if it is a yellow tie and ❌ if it is not.
- Person 1: She is wearing a red-colored uniform and no visible tie. ❌
- Person 2: He is wearing a red-colored uniform and no visible tie. ❌
- Person 3: He is wearing a dark suit with a red tie. ❌
- Person 4: He is wearing a dark suit with a red tie. ❌
- Person 5: He is wearing a dark suit with a yellow tie. ⚠️
- Person 6: He is wearing a dark suit with a green tie. ❌
- Person 7: She is wearing a red-colored uniform and no visible tie. ❌

So Person 5 is the person wearing a yellow tie.

# Step 2: Identify all the people to the right of Person 5
The order from left to right is [Person 7, Person 5, Person 3, Person 4, Person 6, Person 2, Person 1].
People to the right of Person 5 are Person 3, Person 4, Person 6, Person 2, Person 1.

# Summarize and Re-Check answer
Let's now recheck our answer and put ✅ for the target people and ❌ for others
- Person 1: She is to the right of the person wearing a yellow tie. ✅
…
- Person 5: He is the person wearing a yellow tie (reference person). ⚠️
- Person 6: He is to the right of the person wearing a yellow tie. ✅

Question: Please detect person wearing cloth that has letter A
Answer:
<think> OK, the user needs us to detect the person wearing cloth that has letter A. To accomplish this task, I need to break it down into the following steps:
- Step 1: Find all the people in the image.
- Step 2: Check the clothes of each person to see if there is the letter A on them.

# Step 1: Find all the people in the image.
There are 8 people in the image, listed from left-to-right as person 4, person 6, person 5, person 2, person 3, person 7, person 1, person 8.

# Step 2: Check the clothes of each person to see if there is the letter A on them.
- Person 4: Wearing a pink dress with the word "VOL" on it, no letter A → ❌
- Person 6: Wearing an orange dress with the word "VOL" on it, no letter A → ❌
- Person 5: Wearing a blue shirt with the word "L" on it, no letter A → ❌
- Person 2: Wearing a pink dress with the word "U" on it, no letter A → ❌
- Person 3: Wearing a yellow shirt with the word "N" on it, no letter A → ❌
- Person 7: Wearing a brown shirt with the word "T" on it, no letter A → ❌
- Person 1: Wearing a blue shirt with the word "ER" on it, no letter A → ❌
- Person 8: There is a blue shirt inside the box, but no person 8 is visible in terms of wearing clothes with a letter A, and among the people visible, none have a letter A on their clothes.

We also note that person 4 and person 6 are part of the group mentioned in the additional information, but they still do not have the letter A on their clothes.

&lt;think&gt OK, the user needs us to detect the youngest one. To accomplish this task, I need to break it down into the following steps:
- Step 1: Determine the age-related attributes of each person.
- Step 2: Compare the age-related attributes to find the youngest one.

# Step 1: Determine the age-related attributes of each person
- Person 1: A young girl with light-colored hair, wearing a white outfit. She appears to be a child. ⚠️
- Person 2: A woman with long brown hair, wearing a light-colored top and white pants. She is an adult. ❌
- Person 3: A man with short hair, wearing a beige sweater and brown pants. He is an adult. ❌
- Person 4: A young boy with light-colored hair, wearing a patterned shirt. He appears to be a child. ⚠️

# Step 2: Compare the age-related attributes to find the youngest person
Among the four people, Person 1 and Person 4 are children, while Person 2 and Person 3 are adults. Comparing Person 1 and Person 4, they both seem to be of similar young-age, but based on visual cues like height and overall appearance, Person 4 appears to be slightly younger.
